## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant red (#E63946) reminiscent of classic movie posters and cinema signage, chosen for its bold and attention-grabbing qualities.
- Background color: A desaturated light red (#F1D5D7) creating a soft, unobtrusive backdrop that complements the primary red.
- Accent color: A pink (#A8DADC), adds a modern touch, while remaining visually connected.
- Font Pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Poppins' will give a geometric and contemporary style headlines, with 'PT Sans' as the body giving a touch of warmth to balance things out
- Use clear and consistent icons for event types (movies, shows, etc.).
- Center the modal vertically and horizontally, dimming the background with a semi-transparent overlay.
- Implement smooth modal transitions, such as fade-in and slide-up animations.
